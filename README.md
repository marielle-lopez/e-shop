## Task Completion History

### January 30, 2024

- Fixed main content to fill remaining vertical space in browser

### January 27, 2024

- Added an 'On Sale' label to discounted products that would appear on the product page

Didn't have a lot of time today; majority of the work done today was associated with styling. I added a sale label that would display if a specific product variant was discounted, formatted prices to 2 decimal places and ensured product images are not stretched. The next mini goal would be to display the original price of discounted products, as well as show the percentage taken off from the original price.

### January 25, 2024

- Fixed a bug with the Button component when a prop function wasn't passed
- Added hover animations to links and buttons
- Created a backup database to use when quota on original database is reached
- Utilised ChatGPT to generate content for the Returns, Privacy Policy, and Terms of Service pages

There appears to be a bug with the email input in the footer. For some reason, you can't directly click on it to enter input. I utilised the element selector feature in the 'Inspect' view on my browser - it turns out that the overlaying carousel content lays on top of the email input. To fix this, I adjusted the carousel content wrapper height to match that of the carousel image.

I also changed the primary font of the application to Inter, which fit the aesthetic I was after better than Helvetica did.

Interestingly, I reached the quota on my database, so I had to create backup one to work with to continue developing. I will admit that my original database has a lot of data, and it doesn't help that I have a listener constantly watching for changes in my cart collection. So, my backup database contains much less data (only 2 products). I'd like to see if I can reduce the amount of reads from my original database and to help cut my reads and writes in half, I turned off Strict Mode.

I placed `console.log()` statements in each function that requests to interact with the database and found that the listener for cart data was being called many, many time - the quota drainer.

### January 24, 2024

- Linked button in carousel to corresponding product page
- Made audio format buttons on product page functional and applied styling depending on whether the audio format is or isn't selected
- Created and styled NumberInput component that has a minimum and maximum input value based on the available quantity of the selected product
- Created functions to add and remove products to cart from the product page

I've managed to make the buttons representing the available audio formats of a product functional. When on a specific product page, clicking a different audio format displays it's corresponding price. I've also created a re-usable NumberInput component to deal with quantities. Additionally, I added a wrapper component, PaddingWrapper, to mimic the spacing of content as designed in my mockup.

I've hit a milestone - I was able to implement the shopping cart feature, but it needs to be refined. The cart items rendered on the cart page immediately update the database and the cart page itself. At the moment however, if the same audio format of a product is added to the cart, and if that particular audio format of the product already exists in the cart, it doesn't adjust the quantity. It insteads renders a new cart item card. This is because in the database, a new cart item is generated instead of checking if the same product and its audio format already exists in the database.

The next step is to get the product information (specially the quantities of each available audio format) to display real-time quantities. I also need to consider other cases such as out-of-stock items and items that are not yet available for sale.

### January 23, 2024

- Added additional products to Firestore database
- Made each product card a link to a corresponding product page via React Router DOM
- Added foundational content to display in produce page component
- Created cart and favourites pages, added links to such pages into navigation bar, and constructed context for cart
- Created cart feature-related components and begun functionality

Today, I was able to create a product page to display a selected user-selected product on the 'Products' page. It doesn't display all available audio formats for sale, nor does it allow for proper user interactivity, but the foundations are there!

I've also added pages for favourited products and the user's shopping cart with corresponding buttons in the navigation bar. The 'Cart' page in particular displays information fetched from the Firestore database; via a function that grabs information in the 'cart' collection. The next step is to figure out how I want to properly store cart items in the Firestore database. This'll probably involve me having to sketch out a schema.

One of the small tasks I completed was styling the overlaying information of the carousel component. I found that PNG images cannot have a drop shadow applied to the image itself; it was applying around the border of the image instead. I managed to fix this with the help of this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3186688/drop-shadow-for-png-image-in-css).

The next big milestone to reach is a fully functional shopping cart feature. This would entail a user being able to add a specific audio format of a product to their cart, and allowing them to add a user-specified quantity.

### January 22, 2024

- Constructed a basic and function carousel component
- Created a Firestore database with some data
- Created fetching functions to grab data from Firestore database
- Utilised data fetched from Firestore database to display information in carousel component

I've created a simple carousel component for the landing page to showcase featured products. It's not pretty, but it works! It can be further refactored to increase the modularity of my code, but for now I'm focusing on the minimum viable product goals of this project. I've also managed to create a Firestore database with some data, made a reference to the service, and successfully fetched data from it to load information into the carousel component!

### January 18, 2024

- Started a design mockup of the React application
- Created basic header and functional navigation bar component

The first thing I needed to do was to brainstorm what my fake online store was going to sell, and came up with the idea of physical audio formats (i.e., CDs, vinyls, and cassettes). Since they're quite 'old', I thought it would be cool to contrast this with a modern aesthetic for the React application.

As usual, I started a design mockup of my fake online store (in Figma) to get a clear image of what I wanted the final product to look like. I went with a very simple colour palette which uses black as the background colour, white as the foreground, and a dark sky blue for an accent colour.

I've also constructed a basic header and a functional navigation bar to start off the code of this project.
