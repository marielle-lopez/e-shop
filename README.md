## Task Completion History

### January 23, 2024

- Added additional products to Firestore database
- Made each product card a link to a corresponding product page via React Router DOM

### January 22, 2024

- Constructed a basic and function carousel component
- Created a Firestore database with some data
- Created fetching functions to grab data from Firestore database
- Utilised data fetched from Firestore database to display information in carousel component

I've created a simple carousel component for the landing page to showcase featured products. It's not pretty, but it works! It can be further refactored to increase the modularity of my code, but for now I'm focusing on the minimum viable product goals of this project. I've also managed to create a Firestore database with some data, made a reference to the service, and successfully fetched data from it to load information into the carousel component!

### January 18, 2024

- Started a design mockup of the React application
- Created basic header and functional navigation bar component

The first thing I needed to do was to brainstorm what my fake online store was going to sell, and came up with the idea of physical audio formats (i.e., CDs, vinyls, and cassettes). Since they're quite 'old', I thought it would be cool to contrast this with a modern aesthetic for the React application.

As usual, I started a design mockup of my fake online store (in Figma) to get a clear image of what I wanted the final product to look like. I went with a very simple colour palette which uses black as the background colour, white as the foreground, and a dark sky blue for an accent colour.

I've also constructed a basic header and a functional navigation bar to start off the code of this project.
